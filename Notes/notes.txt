NODE.JS REST APIs:

    REST APIs are used to access and manipulate data using a common set of stateless operations.
    These operations are integral to the HTTP protocol and represent essential create, read, update,
    and delete (CRUD) functionality, although not in a clean one-to-one manner.

    The HTTP Operations Here are:
		POST -(create a resource or generally provide data).
		GET -(retrieve an index of resources or an individual resource).
		PUT -(create or replace a resource).
		PATCH -(update/modify a resource).
		DELETE -(remove a resource).
